title: Sui Client PTB CLI
description: The Sui Client PTB CLI enables a user to construct a PTB and execute it from the command line or a file.
---

The `client ptb` command allows users to specify the transactions to be executed in a Programmable Transaction Block directly from your CLI. For maximum flexibility, a file containing the transactions to be executed in a PTB can be passed as well, and the two can be mixed to create and run a complex PTB directly from your terminal.

## Commands

The following list itemizes all the available args for the `sui client ptb` command. Use the `--help` for a long help version that includes some examples on how to use this command.

```
Build, preview, and execute programmable transaction blocks. Depending on your shell, you might have to use quotes around arrays or other passed values. Use --help to see examples for how to use the core functionality of this command.

Usage: sui client ptb [OPTIONS]

Options:
      --assign <NAME> <VALUE>                                         Assign a value to a variable name to use later in the PTB.
      --gas-coin <ID>                                                 The object ID of the gas coin to use. If not specified, it will try to use the first gas coin that it finds that has at least the requested gas-budget balance.
      --gas-budget <MIST>                                             The gas budget for the transaction, in MIST.
      --make-move-vec <TYPE> <[VALUES]>                               Given n-values of the same type, it constructs a vector. For non objects or an empty vector, the type tag must be specified.
      --merge-coins <INTO_COIN> <[COIN OBJECTS]>                      Merge N coins into the provided coin.
      --move-call <PACKAGE::MODULE::FUNCTION> <TYPE> <FUNCTION_ARGS>  Make a move call to a function.
      --split-coins <COIN> <[AMMOUNT]>                                Split the coin into N coins as per the given array of amounts.
      --transfer-objects <TO> <[OBJECTS]>                             Transfer objects to the specified address.
      --publish <MOVE_PACKAGE_PATH>                                   Publish the move package. It takes as input the folder where the package exists.
      --upgrade <MOVE_PACKAGE_PATH>                                   Upgrade the move package. It takes as input the folder where the package exists.
      --preview                                                       Preview the list of PTB transactions instead of executing them.
      --summary                                                       Show only a short summary (digest, execution status, gas cost). Do not use this flag when you need all the transaction data and the execution effects.
      --warn-shadows                                                  Enable shadow warning when including other PTB files. Off by default.
      --json                                                          Return command outputs in json format
  -h, --help                                                          Print help (see more with '--help')
```

## Design philosophy and concepts

The main philosophy behind the CLI PTB support is to enable a user to either build and execute a PTB from the command line or a file. To enable seamless construction and execution of PTBs, this command was designed to allow you to provide a PTB from the console, a file, or mixing both at the same time. Furthermore, bash scripts can be used to construct and execute the PTB just as you would do from the command line, providing great flexibility when it comes to automating different tasks. 

Besides using existing [traditional PTB](/concepts/transactions/prog-txn-blocks/) related concepts, we introduce a few new and important concepts for this command. 

:::warning
Note that all the following examples were tested using a `bash` shell environment, and your experience may vary depending on how your shell will interpret command line arguments and values (e.g., zsh requires to pass values in brackets by adding quotes around it: "[]"; bash accepts them without quotes).
:::

### Addresses and Object IDs
You can pass addresses and objects IDs by prefixing them with '@'. This is needed to distinguish a hexadecimal value from an address in some situations. Here are some examples for `transfer-objects` and `gas-coin`:
```bash
sui client ptb --transfer-objects @0x02a212de6a9dfa3a69e22387acfbafbb1a9e591bd9d636e7895dcfc8de05f331 --gas-coin @0x00002819ee07a66e53800495ccf5eeade8a02054a2e0827546c70e4b226f0495
```

:::tip
For addresses that are in your local wallet, you can use their alias instead.
:::

### Assign
The `--assign` argument is used to bind values to variables. There are two ways you can use it:
* assign a value to a variable
* assign a variable to the result of the previous command

Let's look at the first case where we assign a value to a variable. Let's say we want to check if some variable's value is none. We call the `0x1::option::is_none` function from the Sui framework, and pass in the variable name like this: 
```bash
sui client ptb \
--assign my_variable none \
--move-call 0x1::option::is_none "<u64>" my_variable \
--gas-budget 50000000
```

In the second case, if a previous command outputs some result, it can be binded to a variable in order to be accessed later. Let's see an example where we want a new coin with 1000 MIST, which we can achieve by using the `split-coins` command. Once we do that, we want to transfer the new coin to another address. Without the `--assign` argument, we would not be able to instruct the CLI to transfer that new coin object as we would not have a way to refer to it.

```bash
sui client ptb \
--split-coins gas [1000] \
--assign coins \
--transfer-objects @recipient_address [coins] \
--gas-budget 50000000
```

:::tip
`gas` is a reserved word and the tool will not allow you to name your variable gas.
:::

:::tip
If you build a complex PTB, use the `--preview` flag to display the PTB transaction list instead of executing it.
:::

## Examples

The following examples demonstrate how to use the `client ptb` command.

:::tip
When a PTB is executed, the output contains all the relevant information (tx data, gas cost, effects, object changes, etc.). Use `--summary` to get a short summary when you do not need all the data. For complex PTBs, you can use `--preview` to display the PTB transaction list instead of executing it.
:::

### Move call
When needing to execute a move call, use the `--move-call` transaction to call a specific function from a package. The CLI PTB supports name resolution, so you can use both `0x1::option::is_none` as well as `std::option::is_none` for passing the function name. 

```bash
--assign A none
--move-call std::option::is_none<u64> A
```

### Split, destroy, and merge coins

The following example showcases how to split a gas coin into multiple coins, make a move call to destroy one or more of the new coins, and finally merge the coins that were not destroyed back into the gas coin. It also showcases how to use framework name resolution (e.g., `sui::coin` instead of `0x1::coin`) and how to refer to different values in an array using the `.` syntax.

```bash
# Split off from gas
--split-coins gas [0,1,2,3]
--assign coins
--move-call sui::coin::destroy_zero<sui::sui::SUI> coins.0
# Can further split a split coin (and through variable bindings/result accesses)
--split-coins coins.1 [0,0]
--assign zcoins
# Destroy both new coins
--move-call sui::coin::destroy_zero<sui::sui::SUI> zcoins.0
--move-call sui::coin::destroy_zero<sui::sui::SUI> zcoins.1
# Can merge the split coins back
--merge-coins gas [coins.1, coins.2, coins.3]
--gas-budget 10000000
```

### Transfer objects

This example creates three new coins from gas and transfers them to a different address.

```bash
# Split off from gas
--split-coins gas [1,2,3]
--assign s
# Transfer the three new coins to a different address
--transfer-objects @recipient_address [s.0, s.1, s.2]
--gas-budget 10000000
```

:::info
You can also pass an alias (without the '@') instead of an address.

## JSON output

Append the `--json` flag to commands to format responses in JSON instead of the more human-friendly default Sui CLI output. This can be useful for extremely large datasets, for example, as those results can have a troublesome display on smaller screens. In these cases, the `--json` flag is useful.
